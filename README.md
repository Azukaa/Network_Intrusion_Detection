# Network_intrusion_detection

**This project applies machine learning models on the KDD dataset of network flow traffic to determine anomalies in computer networks.

Dataset cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis carried out and num_outbounds_cmds attribute was removed from the dataset as it was shown to not add any effect to the dataset.

Machine learning modeling was carried out on the cleaned dataset using Linear Regression and Decision Tree classifier and it was proven that Decision Tree gave better results.

Analysis to get the most important features were also carried out and Machine learning modeling was also carried out on on the important features and it was observed that we got better and accurate predictions.

For Future work, I plan to use more ML algorithms and also apply a Deep learning model.
